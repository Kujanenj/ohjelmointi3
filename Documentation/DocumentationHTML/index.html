Overview</h1>
<p>The bronze adventures game is a two player game. Players both control Nexuses, which the opposing player must destroy. The players construct buildings using resources. The buildings can either produce more resources, or upgrade the players minions. What are minions you i hear you ask? The minions are movable units that can fight the enemy minions, or destroy enemy buildings!</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="Instructions"></a>
Instructions</h1>
<p>This section contains information on moving, building and attacking. </p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="Moving"></a>
Moving</h2>
<p>To move a friendly minion, first select it with left click of your mouse. This will popup some text on the right side of the screen, detaling the minion in question. Once you have selected a minion, simply right click on your mouse where you want to go! The destination must be with in the minions move value, (Diagonal movement costs 2) and must not contain minions or enemy buildings. Otherwise the move command might fail, or you might attack the enemy! </p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="Attacking"></a>
Attacking</h2>
<p>If you wish to attack an enemy minion or building, try to move on top of it. (Movement restrictions apply). If the requirements are met, your unit will deal its attack damage to the opposing unit. Beware, some units have special attacks that can have negative effects for your own units! Some units also take less damage from attacks. If a units health drops down to 0, it will be destroyed and removed from the game. </p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="Building"></a>
Building</h2>
<p>To build a building, first select "Add building". This will open up a dialog to select the diffrent type of buildings. Select the one you wish to construct. A text label will now appear on the right side of your screen. It will detail the cost, production and placement rules of the building. If you are satisfied with your selection, left click on the tile you wish to place your building. Then select confirm build action button. Assuming you had the required resources, and tile placement, the building will now be constructed. Take note however, that only 1 building can be placed on a given tile. </p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="Altars"></a>
Altars</h2>
<p>You may have noticed special buildings called Altars. These can be constructed with the same rules as normal buildings, but they have a speccial action at the end of the turn. If a minion ends its turn under an altar, it will be upgraded to a champion. Melee champions are tanky, ranged champions are fast, and magic champions have a special Area of effect attack. This upgrade costs no resources. Afther an upgrade, the altar will go on cooldown for a set amount of turns. Afther the cooldown has expired, the altar can upgrade another minion. </p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="Winning"></a>
Winning</h2>
<p>To win the game, simply destroy the enemy Nexus to instantly win the game, and be declared master of all bronze players! (So silver)</p>
